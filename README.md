# Emacs for a vim user. vi improved, improved.

This is a nearly wholesale clone of [Chris Mccord's emacs config](https://github.com/chrismccord/dot_emacs), down to plugins and key bindings. All configuration is located in `init.el`, should be easy to customize, and has been tailored for a vim user who wants the best of both worlds.
